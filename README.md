# üß© 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Search Algorithm

A Python implementation of the **A\*** (A-Star) search algorithm to solve the classic **8-Puzzle problem**.  
The program explores possible board configurations and finds the shortest sequence of moves from the initial state to the goal state using a heuristic function.

## üß± System Overview

### **Problem Definition**
The **8-Puzzle** is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3√ó3 grid with tiles numbered 1‚Äì8 and one blank space.  
The objective is to move the tiles until the configuration matches the target state.

### **Algorithm Used**
**A\*** search algorithm:  
- **Cost Function:** `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`  
  - `g(n)` ‚Üí cost from the start node  
  - `h(n)` ‚Üí heuristic estimate of distance to goal  
- **Heuristic:** Tile mismatch count (can be upgraded to Manhattan distance for better accuracy)

## üß† How It Works

1. **Initial State:** A user-defined 3√ó3 matrix representing the starting board.  
2. **Target State:** The desired final configuration (usually `[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]`).  
3. **Move Generation:**  
   - The blank (0) can move **up, down, left, or right** if space permits.  
4. **Heuristic Evaluation:**  
   - Counts misplaced tiles relative to the goal state.  
5. **Priority Queue:**  
   - The lowest `f(n)` value (cost + heuristic) is explored next.  
6. **Solution Path:**  
   - When the target configuration is found, all moves are printed in sequence.
